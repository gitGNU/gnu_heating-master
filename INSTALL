Prerequesites:
  -You need at least G++ version 4.7 . The Makefile tries to invoke it
   via "g++". So if you have more than one g++ version isntalled, make
   sure, that the "g++" link points to the right version.
  -You need the Gtkmm library. On debian systems that would be the
   package libgtkmm-3.0-dev

   run "make dep cmdline"
